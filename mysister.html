    <h3 class="d">2. The First Incident:</h3>
    <p>While walking home from school, the protagonist accidentally saves a cultivator or defeats a small-time villain by simply being in the wrong place at the right time. They chalk it up to pure luck, but the world starts to take notice.</p>

    <h3 class="d">3. Suspicion Grows:</h3>

    <h3 class="d">7. Unknowingly Saving the World:</h3>

    <h2 class="d">Twists and Mysteries:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The protagonist might have an ancient bloodline or connection to powerful forces that explains their accidental success.</li>

        <li>The ancient book could have been left by a powerful, long-forgotten cultivator who chose the protagonist as their successor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="d">Ending:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Climactic Battle (Accidental Victory):</strong> The protagonist stumbles into a final showdown with the ultimate villain, unaware of their danger. They defeat the villain in an absurd, comedic way, much to the shock of the world.</li>
        <li><strong>Slice-of-Life Conclusion:</strong> After saving the world, the protagonist returns to normal life, still clueless about their abilities. They pass their exams and continue studying with their sister, who smiles knowingly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="d">Writing Style Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Humor:</strong> Emphasize the protagonist’s obliviousness and the misunderstandings it creates. Their deadpan reaction to major events can contrast with the growing chaos around them.</li>
        <li><strong>Action Scenes:</strong> When writing action, make the protagonist’s victories seem accidental and almost effortless, contrasting with the epic battles unfolding around them.</li>
        <li><strong>Sibling Bond:</strong> Balance the humor with touching moments between the protagonist and their sister, as their dynamic is central to the story.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="d">Additional Suggestions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Include funny training sessions where the protagonist "fails" yet still accidentally masters techniques far beyond their level.</li>
        <li>Explore the comedic tension between the protagonist wanting a quiet life and the world pulling them into grander adventures.</li>
    </ul>
