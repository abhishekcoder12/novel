    <p>A fictional kingdom in a medieval or early-modern era, with a royal family at its helm. The kingdom is known for its vast natural resources and thriving economy.

    <p>Through his work, the crown prince uncovers a deeper conspiracy threatening the kingdom. This leads him on a journey to not only help the people but to reform the kingdom from the inside.
